2025-08-07 20:08:39,"Dear Student,

Please find below important information regarding your upcoming demo:

Who: Your demo will be assessed by an inspector—a member of staff other than your supervisor. We will inform you who your assigned inspector is by the end of this week. Where: The demo can be conducted either online (via Zoom) or in person, as agreed between you and your inspector. When: Demos will be held between 18th and 22nd August. The specific date and time will be arranged directly between you and your inspector. What: You need to prepare a slide deck of up to 10 slides in advance. The demo session will include:
A 5-minute presentation where you walk through your slides to introduce and outline your project.

Followed by 15–20 minutes of questions and discussion led by the inspector.

Please email your slide deck to your inspector by 5:00 PM on Friday, 15th August, so they have time to review and familiarise themselves with your work.

Tips for Slide Deck and Q&A Preparation
While you may structure your slide deck as you see fit, a typical format includes:

Background / Motivation (1–2 slides)

Methodology / Design (1–2 slides)

Experimental Design and Results / Product (2–3 slides)

Conclusion and Future Work (1 slide)

What your inspector may assess during the Q&A:

Your grasp of the project and its goals

The rationale behind your design choices

Your understanding of the code and techniques used

Your ability to distinguish your work from GenAI contributions

If you have any questions, feel free to drop by during my weekly office hour (12:30–14:30, Wed). The Zoom link is https://bham-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/2066382427
